The proposed system integrates deep learning-based classification with 3D visualization to enhance both the accuracy and interactivity of white blood cell (WBC) analysis. 
Traditional WBC classification methods often rely on manual examination, which can be subjective and time-consuming.
By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification and Blender-based 3D modeling, the system provides an advanced approach for medical diagnostics and educational applications.
The integration of artificial intelligence in medical imaging has revolutionized diagnostic processes, especially in fields like hematology, 
where identifying different types of blood cells is crucial for diagnosing a range of health conditions.
The project is mainly focused on identifying and providing an interactive 3D Visualization of four main types of white blood cells - Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils, and Eosinophils using Microscopic Images.
